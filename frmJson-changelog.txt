FRM JSON Pack - 9/7/2021 (v5)
Biggest Update ever, after a few days of non-stop working, all games were reuploaded to a better server
(thanks tobemorecrazy!) and some json files even made from scratch

- All games were reuploaded
- Quicker downloads
- All flycast naomi and atomiswave games should work
- Preemptive support for upcoming external save states (Getting ready for Flycast GGPO)
- NES roms will be fixed in a future update (thats on frm side)

I also made a ko-fi page if for some reason you want to support me, although I encourage you to
support the fightcade devs, flyinghead (flycast dev) and blueminder (flycast-dojo dev) first!

Please report the games that arent working through a dm on twitter (@lofi1048)
I need to figure out a better way to keep track of this lol.

FRM JSON Pack - 2/15/2021 (v4)

- Fixed some SNES games:
	- samshou.zip
	- samspir.zip
	- sf2tua.zip
	- sf2u.zip
	- ssf2u.zip

- Added the latest version of SF2MIX directly from their download link, it should always grab the latest rom

- Added sfa3aism.zip, a sfa3 hack that is A-ISM locked, its not yet supported by FC2 as of this release.
  but maybe in the next fc2 updates it will be added as a room.

Shoutouts to tobemorecrazy and o-range for testing some corrupted games.
